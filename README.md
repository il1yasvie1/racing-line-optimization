## About the project 
This project focuses on optimizing the racing line for Formula 1 cars on a track. The goal is to determine the optimal path and speed that minimizes lap times. We primarily use the finite difference method and physics-informed neural networks for our analysis.\
The original idea is from the author's Year 1 individual project on Calculus of Variation at Imperial College London, where the optimization problem was framed using variational principles and solved using the finite difference method.\
## Mathematics background
In this project, we focus exclusively on a 2D planar representation of the track, which simplifies the problem by ignoring vertical height differences and the effects of elevation changes on the carâ€™s dynamics. Then the positions of the car can be represented as $(x, y)$.\
Define the track $\mathcal{F}_{xy}$ as the feasible domain of the position $(x, y)$ of the car. In the track, define the initial position $(x_0, y_0) \in \mathcal{F}_{xy}$ and finish line $\Gamma\subset\mathcal{F}_{xy}$.\
Define the path via the arc-length parametrization in the given track by $\mathbf{r}: [0, 1] \to \mathcal{F}_{xy}$ such that
$$\mathbf{r}(0) = (x_0, y_0)  \quad \text{and}\quad \mathbf{r}(1) \in \Gamma$$ We require $\mathbf{r}(s) = (x(s), y(s)) \in [C^2([0, 1])]^2$.\
We also have the time parametrization of the path $$(x(t), y(t)) = (x(s(t)), y(s(t)))$$ Then define the speed on the path $v\in C^1([0, 1])$ by
$$v(s) = v(s(t)) = \frac{ds}{dt}\sqrt{(\frac{dx}{ds})^2 +(\frac{dy}{ds})^2 }$$
Then the total time along the path is given by the integral which is a functional of $(x, y, v)$:
$$ \mathcal{T} := \int_{[0, 1]} \frac{\sqrt{{x'}^2 +{y'}^2 }}{v} ds $$
We finally formulate the following optimization problem:
$$\begin{align*} 
\min_{x,y,v} & \int_{[0, 1]} \frac{\sqrt{{x'}^2 +{y'}^2 }}{v} ds \\
\textit{s.t.}  \quad 0 & \leq v\leq v_{\max}\\
& a_{\min} \leq \frac{v v'}{\sqrt{{x'}^2 +{y'}^2 }} \leq a_{\max}\\
& v^2 \frac{|x'' y' - y''x'|}{({x'}^2 + {y'}^2)^{\frac{3}{2}}} \leq \mu g \\
& (x, y) \in \mathcal{F}_{xy} \\
\end{align*}$$
where $v_{max}$ is the maximum speed of the car, $a_{min}$ is the maximum brake deceleration, $a_{max}$ is the maximum positive acceleration and $\mu$ is the friction coefficient.
