## About the Project
This project focuses on optimizing the racing line for Formula 1 cars on a track. The goal is to determine the optimal path and speed that minimizes lap times. We primarily use the finite difference method and physics-informed neural networks for our analysis. The original idea stems from my Year 1 individual project on Calculus of Variations at Imperial College London, where the optimization problem was framed using variational principles and solved with the finite difference method.

## Mathematics Background
In this project, we concentrate exclusively on a 2D planar representation of the track, simplifying the problem by ignoring vertical height differences and the effects of elevation changes on the carâ€™s dynamics. The positions of the car can be represented as $`(x, y)`$.

We define the track $`\mathcal{F}_{xy}`$ as the feasible domain for the car's position $`(x, y)`$ . Within the track, we identify the initial position $`(x_0, y_0) \in \mathcal{F}_{xy}`$ and the finish line $`\Gamma \subset \mathcal{F}_{xy}`$.
The path is defined via arc-length parametrization in the given track by $`\mathbf{r}: [0, 1] \to \mathcal{F}_{xy}`$ , such that
```math
\mathbf{r}(0) = (x_0, y_0) \quad \text{and} \quad \mathbf{r}(1) \in \Gamma
```
We require $`\mathbf{r}(s) = (x(s), y(s)) \in [C^2([0, 1])]^2`$ .
We also have a time parametrization of the path given by 
```math
(x(t), y(t)) = (x(s(t)), y(s(t)))
```
The speed along the path $`v \in C^1([0, 1])`$ is defined as
```math
v(s) = v(s(t)) = \frac{ds}{dt} \sqrt{\left(\frac{dx}{ds}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dy}{ds}\right)^2 }
```
The total time along the path is given by the integral, which serves as a functional of $`(x, y, v)`$ :
```math
\mathcal{T} := \int_{[0, 1]} \frac{\sqrt{{x'}^2 + {y'}^2}}{v} ds
```
We finally formulate the following optimization problem:
```math
\begin{align*}
\min_{x,y,v} & \int_{[0, 1]} \frac{\sqrt{{x'}^2 + {y'}^2}}{v} ds \\
\textit{s.t.}  \quad 0 & \leq v \leq v_{\max} \\
& a_{\min} \leq \frac{v v'}{\sqrt{{x'}^2 + {y'}^2}} \leq a_{\max} \\
& v^2 \frac{|x'' y' - y'' x'|}{({x'}^2 + {y'}^2)^{\frac{3}{2}}} \leq \mu g \\
& (x, y) \in \mathcal{F}_{xy} \\
\end{align*}
```
where $`v_{\max}`$ is the maximum speed of the car, $`a_{\min}`$ is the maximum braking deceleration, $`a_{\max}`$ is the maximum positive acceleration, and $`\mu`$ is the friction coefficient.
